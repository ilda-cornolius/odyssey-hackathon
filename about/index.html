        <p class="aboutdesc">Welcome to E-Mission! Our goal is to help the government of Brampton and its citizens by creating a globally accessible website 
    for tracking high usage and release of fossil fuels and electricity. Through this, we wish for the ministry of environment and 
    interested individuals to be able to cross check this map with upcoming and completed environmental projects as we continue to improve
    the state of the envirnment. Its super easy to use! The colours represent the intensity of usage and emissions. This grants awareness
    for the user in their quest to fix hotspot areas one at a time.</p>
